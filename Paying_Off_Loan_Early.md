## **Step 0: Promissory Note**
In our case study, **before the borrower receives the personal loan**, they would have to **sign a Promissory Note** as part of the loan agreement.  

### **Process Before Receiving the Loan:**  
1. **Loan Application:** The borrower applies for the loan and provides necessary financial details.  
2. **TILA Disclosure:** The lender presents a **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Notice**, outlining the **APR, total loan cost, and repayment terms** to ensure transparency.  
3. **Promissory Note Signing:** The borrower **must sign the Promissory Note**, legally agreeing to repay the loan under the specified conditions.  
4. **Loan Disbursement:** After signing, the lender transfers the loan amount (minus any fees, like origination fees) to the borrower's account.  

Since the **Promissory Note is legally binding**, once the borrower signs it, they are fully obligated to **repay the loan according to the terms**, even if their financial situation changes. It outlines the loan amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, and consequences of non-payment.

### **Key Elements of a Promissory Note:**

1.  **Loan Amount (Principal):** The total amount borrowed.
    
2.  **Interest Rate:** The percentage charged for borrowing the money.
    
3.  **Repayment Terms:** Details on how and when the loan must be repaid (e.g., monthly payments, lump sum, etc.).
    
4.  **Lender and Borrower Information:** Names and contact details of both parties.
    
5.  **Maturity Date:** The final due date for full repayment.
    
6.  **Late Fees and Default Consequences:** Penalties for missed payments and lender actions in case of default.
    
7.  **Collateral (if applicable):** Whether the loan is secured by an asset (like a car or house).
    

### **Why Is It Important?**

-   **Legal Protection:** Serves as a formal agreement enforceable in court.
    
-   **Clarity:** Clearly defines repayment obligations and terms.
    
-   **Creditworthiness:** Some promissory notes are reported to credit bureaus, affecting the borrower's credit score.

## **Step 1: Understanding the Original Loan Terms**  
After the **Promissory Note** agreement from the **FinWise Bank**, the borrower was given a **TILA Notice**. Below is the following details:

- **Loan Amount Requested:** $4,500  
- **Origination Fee (Processing Fee):** $540  
- **Amount Actually Received:** $3,960  
- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** 35.56%  
- **Monthly Payment:** $149.07  
- **Loan Term:** 59 months (about 5 years)  
- **Total Repayment if Paid in Full:** $8,523.53  
- **Total Interest Paid Over the Life of the Loan:** $4,023.53  

### TILA Notice
The **TILA Notice** refers to disclosures required under the **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)**, a U.S. federal law designed to promote transparency in lending. The TILA Notice ensures that borrowers receive clear and standardized information about the terms and costs of a loan before agreeing to it.

### **Key Elements of a TILA Disclosure (TILA Notice):**
1. **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** – The total cost of borrowing, including interest and fees, expressed as a yearly percentage.
2. **Finance Charge** – The total dollar amount of interest and fees the borrower will pay over the life of the loan.
3. **Amount Financed** – The actual amount the borrower will receive after fees (e.g., origination fees) are deducted.
4. **Total of Payments** – The total amount the borrower will have paid after making all scheduled payments.
5. **Payment Schedule** – A breakdown of the number, amount, and due dates of all loan payments.
6. **Prepayment Penalties or Terms** – If applicable, any charges for paying off the loan early.

### **Purpose of the TILA Notice:**
- Helps borrowers compare loan offers from different lenders.
- Prevents hidden fees and misleading loan terms.
- Protects consumers from predatory lending practices.

### **What Is APR?**  
The **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** represents the total yearly cost of the loan, including interest and fees. In this case, the **35.56% APR** is considered **very high**. Typically, loans with APRs over 30% are considered expensive. This means the borrower will pay significantly more than they originally borrowed due to interest charges.

---

## **Step 2: The Decision to Pay Off Early**  
Instead of following the original 59-month repayment plan, the borrower chose to **pay off the loan early** in **March 2025**, just **24 months into the loan**.

### **Why Pay Off Early?**
1. **To Save on Interest:** The longer you take to repay a loan, the more interest you’ll end up paying. By paying early, you stop the bank from charging you future interest.
2. **To Free Up Monthly Cash Flow:** Once the loan is paid off, the borrower no longer has to make the monthly payments of $149.07, which frees up their cash for other financial goals.
3. **To Improve Financial Stability:** Being debt-free provides more flexibility and peace of mind.

## **Step 3: How Much Interest Was Saved?**  
After paying off early, let’s break down how much the borrower saved:

- **Total Payments Made in 24 Months:**  
  $149.07 × 24 = **$3,577.68**  

- **Remaining Balance When Paid Off:**  
  Estimated at **$2,922**

- **Total Paid to Close the Loan:**  
  $3,577.68 (payments made) + $2,922 (final payoff) = **$6,500**

- **Interest Actually Paid:**  
  $6,500 (Total Paid) - $4,500 (Original Loan) = **$2,298**  

- **Interest Saved:**  
  $4,023.53 (Original Interest) - $2,298 (Interest Paid) = **$1,726 Saved**

### **Key Takeaway:**  
By paying early, the borrower saved **$1,726** in interest, which is a significant amount. Had they continued paying the loan for the full 59 months, they would have paid an additional **$1,726** in interest.

## **Step 4: The Unexpected Refund**  
After paying off the loan early, the borrower received a **refund of $192.24** from the bank on **April 1, 2025**.

### **Why Did They Get a Refund?**  
1. **Refund of Unearned Interest:** Since the bank expected to earn $4,023.53 in interest over 59 months, but only received $2,298, they had to refund the extra interest.
2. **Overpayment Refund:** Sometimes, banks calculate the final payment slightly higher than necessary. If you overpay, the extra amount is refunded.

### **What Should You Do If You Get a Refund?**  
- **Check Your Loan Statement:** Review your loan statement to confirm why you received the money.
- **Contact the Bank:** If you're unsure about the refund, reach out to your lender for clarification.

## **Step 5: Why Was This Loan Expensive?**  
This loan is considered **expensive** because of its **high APR of 35.56%**, which means the borrower paid nearly **90% more** than they borrowed over the course of the loan (in terms of interest).

### **Why Did This Loan Have Such a High APR?**
1. **Credit Score:** Borrowers with **lower credit scores** tend to be charged higher interest rates because lenders consider them riskier. This is one reason why this loan might have had a high APR.
2. **Lender’s Terms:** Some lenders, like **FinWise Bank**, specialize in high-interest loans for people who may not qualify for loans from traditional banks or credit unions.
3. **Loan Type:** Short-term loans, payday loans, and some personal loans tend to have higher APRs because they carry more risk for lenders.

## **Step 6: Steps to Avoid Expensive Loans**  
If you're considering taking out a loan, here are some important steps you could take to **avoid high APR loans** in the future:

### **1. Improve Your Credit Score**
- **Why It Matters:** A higher credit score means lower interest rates. Lenders reward you for being a responsible borrower.
- **How to Improve:** Pay bills on time, reduce credit card debt, and check your credit report regularly for errors.

### **2. Shop Around for Better Loan Offers**
- **Why It Matters:** Different lenders offer different interest rates and fees. Shopping around ensures you get the best possible deal.
- **How to Shop:** Use loan comparison tools online, or talk to your bank or credit union about loan options.

### **3. Consider a Secured Loan**
- **Why It Matters:** Secured loans (where you put up collateral, like a car or home) often have lower interest rates because they’re less risky for lenders.
- **How to Do It:** If you own valuable assets, consider using them as collateral to get a better loan rate.

### **4. Explore Alternative Lenders**
- **Why It Matters:** Not all lenders charge sky-high rates. Some online lenders or credit unions offer competitive rates for personal loans.
- **How to Do It:** Research online platforms and credit unions that offer personal loans with lower APRs.

### **Additional Insights:**

1. **Early Payoff Versus Other Financial Goals**  
   While paying off loans early is a great way to save on interest, consider whether the money could be better used elsewhere, like contributing to a retirement fund or paying down high-interest credit card debt. Weighing these priorities can help you make a more informed decision about where your extra funds should go.

2. **Loan Refinancing**  
   If you can’t pay off your loan early but want to reduce your APR, refinancing might be an option. This involves replacing your existing loan with a new one, ideally with a lower interest rate. This could be a good strategy if you’ve improved your credit score since taking out the loan.

3. **Prepayment Penalties**  
   Always check if your loan has a **prepayment penalty** before deciding to pay it off early. Some lenders charge a fee for paying off loans early because they lose out on interest. Make sure to factor this into your calculations to ensure that early repayment is still beneficial.

4. **Alternative Financing Options**  
   If you find yourself in a situation where you need a loan but have bad credit, explore **peer-to-peer lending** or **crowdfunding** platforms. They sometimes offer more flexible rates than traditional lenders, and some platforms cater specifically to those with less-than-ideal credit scores.

5. **The Impact of Early Payoff on Credit Score**  
   Paying off a loan early can have a positive impact on your credit score, as it shows you can responsibly manage debt. However, it may slightly lower your score initially by reducing your credit mix or the average age of your accounts. Over time, the benefits of being debt-free will likely outweigh the temporary dip in your score.
