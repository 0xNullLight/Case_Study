## Step 0: Promissory Note

Before the borrower receives the personal loan, they must sign a **Promissory Note** as part of the loan agreement.

### Process Before Receiving the Loan:
1. **Loan Application:** The borrower submits a loan application with necessary financial details.
2. **TILA Disclosure:** The lender provides a **Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Notice** outlining the APR, total loan cost, and repayment terms.
3. **Promissory Note Signing:** The borrower signs the legally binding Promissory Note, agreeing to repay the loan under the specified conditions.
4. **Loan Disbursement:** Once signed, the lender disburses the loan amount (minus any fees such as origination fees) to the borrower's account.

### Key Elements of a Promissory Note:
- **Loan Amount (Principal):** The total sum borrowed.
- **Interest Rate:** The percentage charged for borrowing the money.
- **Repayment Terms:** Details of when and how the loan must be repaid (e.g., monthly payments, lump sum, etc.).
- **Lender and Borrower Information:** Names and contact details of both parties.
- **Maturity Date:** The due date for full repayment.
- **Late Fees and Default Consequences:** Penalties for missed payments and consequences of default.
- **Collateral (if applicable):** Any asset (like a car or home) securing the loan.

### Importance:
- **Legal Protection:** Acts as a formal, enforceable agreement.
- **Clarity:** Defines all repayment obligations and terms clearly.
- **Creditworthiness:** May be reported to credit bureaus, affecting the borrower’s credit score.

## Step 1: Understanding the Original Loan Terms

After signing the Promissory Note, the borrower receives a **TILA Notice** from FinWise Bank with these details:

- **Loan Amount Requested:** $4,500  
- **Origination Fee (Processing Fee):** $540  
- **Amount Actually Received:** $3,960  
- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** 35.56%  
- **Monthly Payment:** $149.07  
- **Loan Term:** 59 months (about 5 years)  
- **Total Repayment if Paid in Full:** $8,523.53  
- **Total Interest Paid Over the Life of the Loan:** $4,023.53  

### TILA Notice Explained
The TILA Notice is a requirement under the Truth in Lending Act, ensuring transparency by disclosing:
- **APR:** Total yearly cost including interest and fees.
- **Finance Charge:** The full dollar amount of interest and fees.
- **Amount Financed:** The actual funds received after fees.
- **Total of Payments:** The overall amount paid by the end of the loan term.
- **Payment Schedule:** A breakdown of payment numbers, amounts, and due dates.
- **Prepayment Penalties or Terms:** Any fees associated with early repayment.

### Why It Matters:
- Allows borrowers to compare loan offers.
- Prevents hidden fees and misleading terms.
- Protects against predatory lending practices.

### What Is APR?
The **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** reflects the total yearly cost of borrowing. In this case, a **35.56% APR** is exceptionally high—loans with APRs over 30% are generally deemed expensive, meaning the borrower pays much more than the principal due to interest charges.

## Step 2: The Decision to Pay Off Early

Instead of following the full 59-month repayment plan, the borrower chose to pay off the loan early—in **March 2025**, after just **24 months**.

### Reasons for Early Payoff:
1. **Save on Interest:** Reduces the total interest paid by stopping future interest accrual.
2. **Improve Cash Flow:** Eliminates the monthly payment of $149.07, freeing up funds for other goals.
3. **Enhance Financial Stability:** Being debt-free provides more financial flexibility and peace of mind.

## Step 3: Calculating Interest Savings

### Payment Breakdown:
- **Total Payments Made in 24 Months:**  
  $149.07 × 24 = **$3,577.68**

- **Remaining Balance at Payoff:**  
  Approximately **$2,922**

- **Total Amount Paid to Close the Loan:**  
  $3,577.68 (payments made) + $2,922 (final payoff) = **$6,500**

### Interest Calculation:
- **Interest Actually Paid:**  
  $6,500 (Total Paid) - $4,500 (Original Loan) = **$2,298**

- **Interest Saved:**  
  $4,023.53 (Original Interest) - $2,298 (Interest Paid) = **$1,726 Saved**

### Key Takeaway:
By paying off early, the borrower saved **$1,726** in interest—significantly reducing the cost of the loan compared to the original plan.

## Step 4: The Unexpected Refund

After early repayment, the borrower received a **refund of $192.24** from the bank on **April 1, 2025**.

### Reason for the Refund:
1. **Refund of Unearned Interest:** The bank expected to earn $4,023.53 in interest over 59 months but only received $2,298, leading to a refund of the unearned portion.
2. **Overpayment Correction:** If the final calculated payoff exceeds the actual balance due, the excess amount is refunded.

### Action Steps:
- **Review Your Loan Statement:** Verify the refund details.
- **Contact Your Lender:** If you have any questions regarding the refund, reach out for clarification.

## Step 5: Why Was This Loan Expensive?

This loan was expensive primarily due to the **high APR of 35.56%**—meaning the borrower paid nearly **90% more** in interest than the principal amount.

### Contributing Factors:
1. **Credit Score:** Lower credit scores lead to higher interest rates because lenders view these borrowers as riskier.
2. **Lender’s Policies:** Lenders like FinWise Bank may specialize in high-interest loans for borrowers who cannot secure loans from traditional institutions.
3. **Loan Type:** Short-term and certain personal loans often carry higher APRs due to increased risk.

## Additional Insights

### Early Payoff Versus Other Financial Goals
While paying off loans early saves interest, sometimes it might be better to allocate extra funds toward higher-priority financial goals (e.g., retirement savings or reducing high-interest credit card debt).

### Loan Refinancing
If early payoff isn’t feasible, refinancing to secure a lower APR could reduce the cost of your loan. This strategy works best if you’ve improved your credit score since the original loan.

### Prepayment Penalties
Always verify if your loan includes a prepayment penalty. These fees can reduce the benefits of early payoff, so factor them into your calculations.

### Alternative Financing Options
For those with poor credit, consider peer-to-peer lending or crowdfunding platforms. Such alternatives sometimes offer more flexible terms than traditional lenders.

### Impact on Credit Score
Paying off a loan early can boost your credit score by showing responsible debt management. However, it may temporarily lower your score by affecting your credit mix or account age. Over time, the benefits of reduced debt typically outweigh any short-term impact.
