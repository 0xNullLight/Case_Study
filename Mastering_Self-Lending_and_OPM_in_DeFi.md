## What is Self-Lending?

Self-lending refers to borrowing funds against your crypto assets, using them as collateral, and leveraging those borrowed funds to scale your exposure, generate passive income, or reinvest into more collateral. Unlike traditional lending, DeFi self-lending allows users to retain ownership of their assets while simultaneously increasing borrowing power.

### Key Features of Self-Lending:

1. **Borrowing against crypto assets** to generate yields.
2. **Reinvesting borrowed funds** into more assets or lending protocols.
3. **Utilizing borrowed funds** to compound returns or generate more value.

## Types of Self-Lending Strategies in DeFi

Self-lending lets you compound returns by continuously borrowing, reinvesting, and using borrowed funds to acquire more collateral. Here are some common self-lending strategies:

| **Self-Lending Type**          | **Description**                                                                 | **Key Protocols**       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Recursive Lending**          | Continuously borrow, reinvest, and buy more collateral, repeating the cycle.   | Instadapp               |
| **Collateral Stacking**        | Deposit collateral, borrow funds, and use borrowed funds to buy more of the same collateral. | Instadapp               |
| **Self-Repaying Loans**        | Borrow funds, and let yield generated from collateral automatically repay the loan. | Alchemix                |
| **Lending for Passive Income** | Lend stablecoins or crypto to borrowers to earn passive interest.               | Teller Protocol         |
| **Interest-Generating Loans**  | Lend assets to generate interest and reinvest the interest to expand collateral. | Teller Protocol         |

## Key Principles of OPM (Other Peopleâ€™s Money) in DeFi

**OPM** in DeFi allows you to borrow assets from platforms or other participants without using your own funds directly. The borrowing is collateralized by your existing crypto holdings, enabling you to leverage other people's liquidity while maintaining exposure to your original assets.

### Why OPM Matters:

- **Capital Efficiency**: Unlock liquidity without selling your assets.
- **Increased Leverage**: Borrow funds to increase your exposure to high-value assets or yield-generating platforms.
- **Accelerated Growth**: Put your assets to work without waiting to accumulate additional capital.
- **Passive Income**: Generate income from borrowed assets via staking, yield farming, etc.

ðŸ’¡ **Example**:  
Deposit **ETH** as collateral, borrow **stablecoins** (like USDC), and use those stablecoins to generate passive income by staking them, all while your original ETH remains untouched.

### 1. Recursive Lending: Borrow, Reinvest, Repeat

Recursive lending is the most dynamic form of self-lending. It allows you to increase exposure and borrowing capacity by continually borrowing against assets and reinvesting the borrowed funds.

In recursive lending, you:

1. Deposit an asset (e.g., **ETH** or **BTC**) as collateral.
2. Borrow stablecoins (like **DAI** or **USDC**).
3. Use the borrowed funds to buy more of the same asset (e.g., **ETH**).
4. Redeploy the new asset back into the collateral pool.
5. Repeat the cycle, amplifying exposure and leverage.

This strategy multiplies your positions without needing additional capital but comes with the **risk of liquidation** if collateral ratios drop too low.

|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Focus**               | **Maximizing Leverage**: Aimed at users who want to increase their collateral and borrowing power continuously. | **Self-Repaying Loans**: Aimed at users who prefer passive management with automatic loan repayment. | **Flexible Borrowing**: Aimed at users who want manual borrowing and repayment with some flexibility. |
| **Recursive Lending Support**    | **True Recursive Lending**: Borrow, redeposit, and borrow again, scaling your borrowing power. | **Semi-Recursive Lending**: Borrow once, self-repay, but no continuous borrowing. | **Limited Recursive Lending**: Borrow, repay, and borrow again manually, no automatic scaling of borrowing power. |
| **Borrowing Capacity Growth**    | **Dynamic Growth**: Borrowing capacity increases each time you redeposit and borrow again. | **Fixed Borrowing Capacity**: Once borrowed, the amount doesnâ€™t increase unless new collateral is added. | **Fixed Borrowing Capacity**: Borrowing capacity remains constant until new collateral is added. |
| **Borrowing Frequency**          | **Frequent**: You can borrow repeatedly as long as your collateral allows. | **One-Time**: Borrowing happens once, and the loan is self-repaying. | **Moderate**: Borrow, repay, and borrow again, but borrowing depends on repaying previous debt. |
| **Control Over Collateral**      | **Full Control**: You can redeploy borrowed funds back into the system to scale your collateral. | **Partial Control**: Collateral does not grow without new deposits. | **Limited Control**: Collateral canâ€™t be redeployed once borrowed funds are used. |
| **Stacking Collateral**          | **Yes**: Redeploy borrowed funds to increase your collateral base and borrowing power. | **No**: Borrowed funds cannot increase collateral base. | **No**: Borrowed funds cannot increase collateral base. |
| **Leverage Potential**           | **High**: Continuous recursive lending allows for scaling leverage over time. | **Limited**: Leverage is fixed after the initial borrowing. | **Low**: Leverage potential is limited to the available collateral. |
| **Interest Rates**               | **Variable** based on underlying protocols (e.g., Compound, Aave). | **Fixed APR**, typically low. | **Dynamic** based on credit scoring and data. |
| **Risk Management**              | **Automatic liquidation protection** in the event of under-collateralization. | **Lower liquidation risk** due to self-repayment, but yield-based risk. | **Higher liquidation risk** due to the reliance on manual repayment. |
| **Collateral Types**             | **Multiple types of collateral** (e.g., stablecoins, ERC-20s). | **Multiple types of collateral** are accepted based on strategies/pool (e.g., stablecoins, ERC-20s) **for borrowing alUSD or alETH**. | **Flexible collateral** based on credit score and available assets. |
| **Flexibility in Loan Terms**    | **Very flexible**, adjustable according to the underlying protocol terms. | **Fixed terms**, no adjustments after borrowing. | **Fixed terms**, but you can manually borrow, repay, and borrow again. **(3 months max on term for creation of pool)**|
| **Passive Income**               | **Earn Interest on Deposits**: Deposit assets like USDC or ETH into Aave, Compound, or other lending protocols via Instadapp to earn interest passively. You can also earn rewards from liquidity pools. Instadapp optimizes yield by switching between protocols based on market conditions, providing passive income with minimal effort. | **Self-Repaying Loan Yield**: Borrow alUSD against your DAI collateral, and the loan will automatically repay itself with yield generated from your DAI deposit. The longer you leave the collateral in, the more you accumulate as the debt is paid down automatically. | **Earn Interest from Borrowing**: Lenders in Teller can earn passive income by providing liquidity for loans, typically receiving interest payments from borrowers based on their credit scores. However, this is more passive lending as opposed to automatic debt repayment or recursive borrowing. |
| **Protocol Transparency**        | **Highly transparent**; relies on well-known protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound). | **Transparent, open-source**, and fully audited. | **Transparent** with decentralized governance and credit-based lending. |
| **Best For**                     | **Advanced Users** seeking continuous leverage and higher exposure to assets. | **Passive Income Seekers** looking for self-repaying loans and less active management. | **Credit-Based Borrowers** who need flexibility but with manual borrowing and repayment. |
